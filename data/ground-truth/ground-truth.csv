For example, if you back out of a note, you should get a warning that your scribble is going to be lost...(uggh). I got lucky and somehow was able to pinch and zoom in -- but I have not been able to replicate something so simple. Clearly it's there -- somewhere, but not where would expect it to be consistently (e.g., everywhere would be nice for larger screen users like me). While you can re-size the note background, and scale the content to size -- you cannot move the block of content to make resizing the note more functional. Nor change the pen inking width (that I could find). Moving notes about -- it is very crude feeling for more serious matters. I have yet to find any 'gestures' to rotate notes, but I did find the 90-degree flip... (not like in the demo with slight rotations). I like the idea of the widget on my Fold3, but I find the integration to the main app to be just to awkward to use. It has plenty of potential -- any maybe buried or hidden functionality waiting for a spelunker. I am also sure it's great in select scenarios/use-cases. Overall, it is cute, but awkward. It stumbles as I tried to use it more... Also, some type of sync across devices would be helpful. The plumbing is already in, so provide an option to move the data to a cloud store (many to choose from) to support multiple devices. All in all, some cool stuff, light feel; but misses in a lot of places.
