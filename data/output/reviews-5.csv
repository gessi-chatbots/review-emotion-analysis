So, after a while my dedicated account was being used to send SPAM and my domain and IP because blacklisted until I figured out it was this account being used to log into my server to send the SPAM. The ONLY explanation is that this app's publisher has a way of gathering non-gmail accounts and passwords and either using them or selling them to SPAMMERS.

Once you have that entered into SMS Backup+ you set up Gmail or even Yahoo to pull emails from your hosted email address.  To do this in Gmail you can only set this up in a desktop size screen, not mobile, then you would click the wheel icon on a desktop, then settings, then Accounts and Import, then scroll down to where it says ""check mail from other accounts"" and you will create a new import using the same IMAP settings you used when entering this info into SMS Backup+.

And - pure genius the way this gets implemented - you get points, weighed per task as you like, for each one done. These add up and can be seen in various ways, calendar, reports, a weekly strip. They allow for comparing and contrasting through time. Essentially, the Seinfeld method - but on steroids. The perfect motivator for getting things done. I've tried many checklist apps in the past, tried to gamify my work in an attempt to keep myself motivated and none of them have worked as successfully as Daily Checklist. It's changed a fair bit over the years. Gradually evolved, sometimes becoming, I think, over complex. Right now, it's hit the sweet spot: is pretty intuitive to set up, is flexible, can be as complex or as simple as your needs require. Give it a fair go and you'll end up buying it.

If I mark the subtasks done in January, they are still marked as done when the main task comes around again in Feb. Having checked the help centre, this appears to be intended functionality and can be worked around, but it's really not practical to do so when you have a lot of subtasks",f_497

I have been looking for something that will allow me to have goals, tasks and habit building all in one. This app has all of that plus the gamification that me as an Old School D&D guy really enjoys.

Everything is just perfect...But can you please add KEEP SCREEN ON option in this app? It will make it more perfect! After all I am satisfied! Thankyou!🥰Edit:Well i moved on from this app, but now i am again using it... The app was last updated a year ago....Pls add these things if you can because it is one of the best apps for study!! 1) Keep screen option 2) Black theme (not a priority) By the i love this app and may developer update this app!!🙁",f_502

The level of customisation and lists within lists, as well as reminders and being able to label things and arrange them by priority makes and now with the new function where you can attach an image it's improving all the time and I love it, the one slight problem I do have however is with the amount of images that you can attach being only one if that were to increase, that would be fabulous",f_502
Tasks: to do list & tasks,PRODUCTIVITY,dac9116c-e1e4-4d39-9a4c-3170e1881715,"Sep 02, 2022",5,I love this app & I use it daily. I have multiple categories of lists. And I like how I can easily reorder what I have within a list based on priority for the day (for my 3 shopping lists i can reorder based on area in the store so there isn't a lot of back & forth walking) I can check off an item once it is in my cart and it drops it down out of the priority and i can focus on the last things i need to find. Get this app if you are a lists person!,f_502

Ad-free version without a coach/ custom running program should also be made available at cheaper one time price, as this app itself is a beautiful app with its basic features.",f_506

It also tells u ur per km speeds. Reviewing again after 9 years and 14000 kms of running....still a very good app, changed from Runtastic to Adidas running & some of the features have been moved to premium version although I was using the Runtastic Pro (paid) version, overall still a good app.",f_506
