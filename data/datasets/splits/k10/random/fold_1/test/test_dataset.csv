In the free version Widgets and importing events doesn't work. Highly recommending the PRO version, which is great. The only issue I find with both is that there is no Sync option with cloud or desktop app. CalDav for some reason doesn't work for me. Edit: I have the PRO version too. CalDAV won't sync properly without refreshing Google calendar, and was thinking of using personal cloud for syncing, to avoid Google entirely.","CalDAV won't sync properly without refreshing Google calendar, and was thinking of using personal cloud for syncing, to avoid Google entirely.",Sadness
