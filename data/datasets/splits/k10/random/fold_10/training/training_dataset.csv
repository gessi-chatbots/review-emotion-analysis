So, after a while my dedicated account was being used to send SPAM and my domain and IP because blacklisted until I figured out it was this account being used to log into my server to send the SPAM. The ONLY explanation is that this app's publisher has a way of gathering non-gmail accounts and passwords and either using them or selling them to SPAMMERS. Perhaps this is one reason why Google won't approve them to use gmail accounts. Anyway, BEWARE!!
